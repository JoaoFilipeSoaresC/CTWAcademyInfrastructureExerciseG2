# CTWAcademyInfrastructureExerciseG2

This project was developed by team 2 of the CTW CI/CD Academy for the Infrastructure module and responds to the following exercise:

  Create a terraform and ansible code to deploy an instance and install the Prometheus stack on it. The instance type should be "Standard_D4_v3". Your             prometheus instance should be able to connect to the instance with the public IP 20.218.85.149 and gather its node exporter metrics, presenting them in a       grafana dashboard.
